# About the dataset 
You can find the dataset in the flights.zip folder. It is recommended to extract the dataset from this folder to parent directory before running the code. 
This dataset was gathered from RITA and contains a list of 583,985 flights that departed and arrived in the month of January, 2019 with many variables of interest like - departure time, arrival time, flight operator, delay reasons/times (NAS, security, carrier, etc.) and many more. <br>

# About the analysis
I wanted to present the analysis in a way to identify patterns and correlation between arrival and departure delays, focus on reasoning behind the flight delays at the busiest airports (as per dataset), identify the worst performing carriers (in terms of maximum delayed flights) and look at trends for these delays.<br>

# Summary
1.Chicago had the highest average departure and arrival delay time. <br>
2.Phoenix, Philadelphia, and Minneapolis had the least average arrival delays. <br>
3.No flight delays were observed between 4AM and 9AM. <br>
4.Flight operators that had highest number of delays are:: WN - Southwest Airlines, OO - SkyWest Airlines, AA - American Airlines, DL - Delta Airlines, UA - United Airlines. <br>
5.B6 (or JetBlue) had the highest average departure and arrival delays because of late aircraft and/or carrier operations. DL (or Delta) and WN (or Southwest) have high average delays but low average arrival delays. UA (or United Airlines) is the most affected by National Air System performance which is the major reason for its flight delays. <br>
6.The first day of the week (Monday) has the highest average departure and arrival delays, majority of which can reasoned in terms of higher average late aircraft delays and delays caused by National Air System.<br>
